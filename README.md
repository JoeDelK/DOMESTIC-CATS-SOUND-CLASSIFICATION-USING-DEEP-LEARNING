# DOMESTIC CATS SOUND CLASSIFICATION USING DEEP LEARNING

Domestic cats are animals able to vocalise a wide range of sounds with different and distinguished meanings. Recognising these sounds could be really useful to help us humans to determine the mood of our feline friends. This work consists on processing cat sounds and automatically classify them, using a dataset containing sounds within a range of 10 categories. Our approach is to compute the mel-spectogram for every sound and classify them using a convolutional neural network. Since the dataset is not large enough to perform a good training, a data augmentation process has been carried out. We have tested four state-of-the-art pre-trained CNNs and compared the results between them. The one which has shown better results is the ResNet50 with an 86% of accuracy.
